Programming test:

Create a task application. Each task consists:

user name;
e-mail;
task description;
Picture;
Start page - a list of tasks with the ability to sort (mandatory) by user name, email and status. There should be 3 tasks per page (with pagination). Any visitor can see the task list and create new ones without registering.

Before saving a new task, you can click "Preview" (mandatory), it should work without reloading the page.

You can attach a picture to the task. Requirements for images - format JPG / GIF / PNG, no more 320Ñ…240 pixels. When trying to upload a larger image, the image should be proportionally reduced to the specified size.

Make an entry for the administrator (login "admin", password "123"). The administrator has the ability to edit the text of the task and change task status. Executed tasks in the general list are displayed with the appropriate mark.

In the application, you need to implement the MVC model with pure PHP. PHP frameworks can not be used, libraries can. Css on bootstrap. There are no special requirements for design, but it should be clean.

Pay attention, accuracy is one of the main criteria for evaluating the test.
